There's a plan for a feature in `docs/prompt_plan.md`. Please read it over. If you have questions, let me know. Otherwise, let's get to work.

Before we get going, update the plan document based on the answers I just gave you.

Please execute the first 3-4 incomplete tasks. If you have questions, please stop and ask me. DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THE PLAN.

Your workflow is:

1. Open **@docs/plans/somefeature.plan.md** and identify any prompts not marked as completed.

2. For each incomplete prompt:
   [ ] Double-check if it's truly unfinished (if uncertain, ask for clarification).
   [ ] If you confirm it's already done, skip it.
   [ ] If you have questions, let me know.
   [ ] Otherwise, implement it as described. You may use the agent `@library-usage-researcher` to find the relevate manual or sample code.
   [ ] Make sure the tests pass, and the program builds/runs
   [ ] Commit the changes to your repository with a clear commit message.
   [ ] Update **`@docs/prompt_plan.md`** to mark this prompt as completed, with âœ….

3. After you finish each prompt, pause and wait for user review or feedback.

4. Repeat with the next unfinished prompt as directed by the user.
