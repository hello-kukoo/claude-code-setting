I've got an idea I want to talk through with you. I'd like you as an architect to help me turn it into a fully formed design and a thorough, step-by-step specification for this idea.

Our end goal is to have a detailed specification (and eventually an implementation plan) which I can hand off to a developer/implementor.

Check out the current state of the project in our working directory to understand where we're starting off, then ask me questions, one at a time, each question should build on my previous answers, to help refine the idea.

Ideally, the questions would be multiple choice, but open-ended questions are OK, too. Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember: only one question per message.

Once you believe you understand what we're doing, stop and describe the design to me, in sections of maybe 200-300 words at a time, asking after each section whether it looks right so far.

Now that weâ€™ve wrapped up the brainstorming process, can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification? Include all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation. Save the document into `docs/spec.md`.

<!--You can use this spec for a number of things. We are doing codegen here, but I have used it to bolster ideas by asking a reasoning model to poke holes in the idea (must go deeper!), to generate a white paper, or to generate a business model. You can pop it into deep research and get a 10k word supporting document in return.-->
